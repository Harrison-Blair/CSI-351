# CSI-351 - Software Testing

This repository was created to store the work I am doing in my Software Testing class over my summer semester. It includes a collection of assignments, discussions, and in-class assignments completed over the course of the semester.

## Course Information

### Course Description

This course exposes students to modern software testing and quality
assurance. Although the course includes testing theory, the emphasis is on
providing practical skills in software testing currently used in industry. To that
end, the course covers the testing process, manual and automated tests, test-
driven and behavior-driven development, and performance testing. Topics
include review/inspection techniques for non-executable software, black-box
and white-box testing techniques for executable software and test analysis.
Specific test-case development techniques such as boundary value,
equivalence class, control paths, and dataflow paths testing are introduced.

### Course Learning Objectives

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:
- Develop a clear and complete test plan and traceability matrix
- Perform manual testing based on a test plan
- Implement and automate unit tests for console-based applications
using a testing framework.
- Automate testing of websites using common/popular open-source
automation tools used in industry.
- Apply test-driven and behavior-driven development techniques in
professional software development projects
